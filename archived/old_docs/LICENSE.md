## System76 Exception

**Additional permission under GNU AGPL version 3 section 7:**

System76, Inc. and the Pop!_OS/COSMIC projects are hereby granted permission to incorporate, modify, and distribute this work under the terms of the **GNU General Public License version 3** (GPL-3.0-or-later) when included in:

- Pop!_OS operating system
- COSMIC desktop environment
- Related System76 open-source projects

This exception allows System76 to maintain license consistency with their existing GPL-3.0 codebase while this work remains AGPL-3.0 for all other uses.

## What This Means

| User | License | Network service requirement |
|------|---------|----------------------------|
| System76 / COSMIC | GPL-3.0 | No (standard GPL terms) |
| Everyone else | AGPL-3.0 | Yes (must share modifications) |

## Why AGPL-3.0?

The AGPL-3.0 exists to ensure that users of network services have the same freedoms as users of traditional software. If you run ionChannel (or derivatives) as a service, you must provide source code to your users.

This prevents "cloud-washing" where companies take open-source work, modify it, run it as a service, and never contribute back.
